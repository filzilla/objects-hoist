## Scope, hoisting and compartmentalization

### Answer the following:
In you own words, explain the concepts of scope, hoisting, compartmentalization.

There are two kinds of scope.  A global scope is when a variable is defined outside of
a function.  Local scope is when a variable is defined within a function, thus restricting
its use to with that function only.

Hoisting is the way javascript loads and uses functions.

Compartmentalization is encapsulating variables within functions, so that they
cannot be modified globally.
